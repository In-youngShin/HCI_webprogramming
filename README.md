## User-Interactive Web Program
This project is part of a class project in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). 
The goal of this project is to implement a user-interactive web application where the results vary based on users' input.
In this program, three questions are presented, and users can interact with these questions by hovering their mouse over the options. 
As users hover over the options, their choices are indicated by changing the colors of the options. Each question is presented within a fixed time frame, and the program automatically moves to the next question when the time is up. 
The program recognizes users' choices based on the option they hovered over last.

This program is developed using JavaScript, D3.js, and Python Flask.
